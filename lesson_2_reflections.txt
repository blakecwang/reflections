What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created. This is probably going to be the folder in which all the
metadata about previous versions is stored.





How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It allows you to choose which files you want to commit at any given time. This way
you can selectively decide in which files you will keep changes and which files will
remain unchanged.
